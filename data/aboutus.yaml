        Bio: |
            Rodrigue is not a computer veteran, though he already spent significant time coding and tinkering computing systems.
            He wrotes his first lines of code in Pascal (2001), then moved to C, C++, Python, Go, etc. In short Rodrigue is now a polyglot coder. He always try to find the right tools for each situation.
            Beyond coding he‚Äôs also happy doing things for operations. With a sustained experience in monitoring, Rodrigue is ‚Äúfluent‚Äù in designing monitoring with tools like MRTG/RRDtool
            (yes, it's old but still working ;)), Nagios/alike, Zabbix, Prometheus, Grafana, to list a few.
            
            Early in 2008, Rodrigue started his journey in cloud during its PhD, focusing on cloud infrastructure management (virtualization, resource allocation and provisioning). He held several
            cloud positions in the industry as cloud engineer (then architect) working with AWS, GCP and Azure technologies. Cloud-native systems with Docker containers and Kubernetes as orchestrator
            was just another step in this still long journey in the cloud. Rodrigue is also author of several [open source projects](https://github.com/rchakode).
