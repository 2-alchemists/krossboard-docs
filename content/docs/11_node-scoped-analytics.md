For each Kubernetes cluster it handles, Krossboard provides the following kinds of charts and reports at the node level.
* Recent occupation by pods
* Usage trends & history 

> **Data Export.** The data backing the different charts can be exported in CSV format. This enables the ability to further process them with your favorite third-party data analytics like [Google BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery), [AWS Athena](https://aws.amazon.com/athena/), [Azure Synapse](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/synapse-analytics/), [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/), [Microsoft Excel](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/excel#pivot-forPersonal), to list a few.
