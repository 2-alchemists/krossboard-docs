The Krossboard software and this website are edited by 2Alchemists SAS, a french company co-founded by [Rodrigue Chakode](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rodriguechakode/) and [Christophe Camel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christophe-camel/).

## Our motivation
We are cloud professionals, with breadth and depth experience building cloud and cloud-native platforms and applications.
**We defend a cost-centric approach of designing, building, and operating cloud services**. That's the spirit of Krossboard.

**Our mission is thus to help organizations understand and master the costs of their cloud platforms.**

## Company founders
**[Rodrigue Chakode, PhD](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rodriguechakode/)** is not a computer veteran, though I already spent significant time coding and tinkering computing systems. I wrote my first lines of code in Pascal (2001), then moved to C, C++, Python, Go, etc. In short I’m now a polyglot coder. I always try to find the right tools for each situation. Beyond coding I’m also happy doing things for operations. With a sustained experience in monitoring, I’m “fluent” in designing monitoring with tools like MRTG/RRDtool (yes, it's old but still working ;)), Nagios/alike, Zabbix, Prometheus, Grafana, to list a few. Early in 2008 I started my journey in cloud during my PhD, focusing on cloud infrastructure management (virtualization, resource allocation and provisioning). I held several cloud positions in the industry as cloud engineer (then architect) working with AWS, GCP and Azure technologies. Cloud-native systems with Docker containers and Kubernetes as orchestrator was just another step in this still long journey in the cloud. I’m also author of several [open source projects](https://github.com/rchakode).

**[Christophe Camel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christophe-camel/)** has over 15 years of experience in the software industry. His career in technology has included the roles of Software Architect, Lead Developer, API evangelist in several companies in a wide variety of fields (avionics, space, video production, industrial maintenance).
Christophe has recently designed an industrial-grade SaaS Cloud solution for a French fast-paced tech company around the Kubernetes technology and significantly contributed to develop the company’s technology strategy.
